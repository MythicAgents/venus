Venus is a [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that acts as an
agent for Mythic C2. It produces a zipped folder of VS Code extension source
code, which currently must be packaged by the operator before delivering to
target/test machines manually or via social engineering.

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then get the `vsce` package and package
your extension you downloaded after running through "Create Payload" on
Mythic like so:

```shell
$ npm install -g vsce
$ unzip venus.zip
$ cd venus
$ vsce package
```

The extension must then be manually installed on target in Visual Studio Code.
This can be done from the editor UI or from the CLI with:

```shell
$ code --install-extension venus-0.0.1.vsix
```

:warning: Doesn't support encrypted payloads yet, always use TLS  
:warning: Not yet dependable enough for operations  
:warning: Only tested against macOS and Linux, but should run anywhere in
Visual Studio Code

## Mythic Payload Type installation

From the top-level directory of Mythic on your C2 server, run the command:

```shell
$ sudo ./install_agent_from_github.sh https://github.com/MythicAgents/venus
```

Once installed, restart Mythic to build a new Venus agent.
