## Summary

Venus is a VS Code extension that acts as an agent for Mythic C2. It's meant to 
be a minimal initial access payload or means of persistence that clearly 
highlights Visual Studio Code's attack surface area. It is cross-platform, 
running on any operating system that can run Visual Studio Code.
